This cookbook installs nginx and [Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/)
using packages compiled by Phusion.  If you want to do extensive nginx
configuration, you may want to use the Opscode
[nginx cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx) instead.

Currently the cookbook is only written for Ubuntu, since it assumes apt for
package install.

The default recipe adds the Phusion repository and installs the passenger and
nginx packages.

# Configuration Attributes

* __use\_passenger\_4:__ If true, use Phusion's Passenger 4 repo rather than
    the main one (which is now Passenger 5). Default false.
* __sites\_dir:__ Directory in which to write our virtualhost files. Defaults
    to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.
* __nginx\_workers:__ NGINX worker count. Defaults to 4.
* __nginx\_connections:__ NGINX worker connection count. Defaults to 768.
* __catch\_default`:__ If true, add an empty virtualhost file that catches all
    requests for hosts other than the ones explicitly registered in virtualhost
    files. Defaults to false.
* __log\_dir:__ Directory for nginx and site log files. Defaults to `/var/log/nginx`
* __certs\_dir:__ Directory for cert files. Defaults to `/etc/nginx/certs`
* __ruby:__ Default Ruby interpreter. Defaults to `/usr/bin/ruby`
* __max\_pool\_size`:__ Max number of passenger instances. Defaults to 8.
* __max\_instances\_per\_app:__ Max number of passenger instances for a single app. Defaults to 0 (unlimited).
* __min\_instances:__ Passenger config for default minimum instances of all apps. Defaults to 2.
* __pool\_idle\_time:__ Max number of seconds a Passenger process may be idle. Defaults to 300.
* __max\_requests:__ Max number of requests a Passenger process will handle. Defaults to 0.
* __cert\_databag:__ What databag should we look for SSL certs in? Defaults to `ssl_certs`
* __redirect\_to\_https:__ If a site supports https, should we redirect http
    requests there? Defaults to true.
* __site\_min\_instances:__ Passenger config for minimum instances of each app. Overrides default `min_instances`. Defaults to 2.
* __site\_max\_body\_size:__ Maximum body size for uploads. Defaults to `8M`
* __keep\_env\_path:__ Tell nginx to pass the PATH environment variable through. Defaults to `true`
* __default\_log\_format:__ What logging format should be used? Defaults to "combined".
    Also available is `combined_timing`, which adds request time and upstream response time.
* __maintenance\_page:__ Default path to a maintenance page. Defaults to `nil`
* __maintenance\_check:__ Default path to a maintenance check. Defaults to `nil`
* __enterprise\_token:__ Enterprise download token for [Passenger Enterprise](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/enterprise). Defaults to `nil`
* __enterprise\_license:__ Remote URL to your Passenger Enterprise license file. Defaults to `nil`

## `nginx_passenger_site`

The `nginx_passenger_site` resource is used to add a Passenger-enabled site
to nginx.

For instance:

    nginx_passenger_site "ewr" do
      action :create
      dir    "/web/ewr/current"
      server "ewr.is"
    end

That call would create an nginx config file at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ewr`
pointing to an app installed at `/web/ewr/current`.  Because it's Passenger,
the nginx root is actually set to `/web/ewr/current/public`.

There are several other attributes that can be set on the resource:

* __name:__ The site key.  "ewr" in the example above.
* __dir:__ The base directory for the application.
* __server:__ The nginx `server_name`
* __rails_env:__ Set the Passenger `rails_env` setting
* __cert:__ Key that specifies an SSL certificate that should be downloaded
    and installed for the app.  Uses a databag specified in
    `node.nginx_passenger.cert_databag`.
* __generate_cert:__ If you do not have a certificate but want your site to be served over https, setting this to true will cause the a key and cert to be automatically generated for you. Note that this certificate will be self signed and should probably not be used in production environments! You can set `node.nginx_passenger.cert_authority` if you wish to change the certificate authority shown on the certificate, which ships as 'Self Signed'.
* __http:__ Should HTTP be supported?  If no cert is provided, the answer
    will be yes, regardless of the value of this flag.  If a cert is provided
    (and HTTPS is therefore enabled), this setting determines whether the
    app should also be served up over HTTP.  If not, you can optionally have
    HTTP access redirect to HTTPS based on the value of
    `node.nginx_passenger.redirect_to_https`.
* __template:__ If you would like to specify custom nginx / Passenger
    configuration, you can specify its name here.  By default, the resource
    will use a stock config that is included.
* __min_instances:__ Passenger's `passenger_min_instances` setting.  By default,
    set to the value of `node.nginx_passenger.site_min_instances`, which ships as
    to 2.
* __max\_body\_size:__ Nginx `client_max_body_size` setting.  Defaults to
    `node.nginx_passenger.site_max_body_size`, which ships as '8M' (8 megabytes).

If `site` resource specifies a `maintenance_page`, traffic will be redirected
there if a given maintenance check file is present.  By default, we look for
`(dir)/IN_MAINTENANCE_MODE`, but a custom file can be specified with
the `maintenance_check` attribute.

This cookbook was written by [Eric Richardson](http://ewr.is), loosely based on
practices developed putting together cookbooks for [Emcien](http://emcien.com).
